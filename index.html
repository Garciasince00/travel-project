            <h2>Why Oaxaca?</h2>
            <h3>The culinary and culture capital of Mexico</h3>
            <p>
              Oaxaca's combo of authentic regional flavor and big city grit
              makes it one of the most intriguing destinations in Mexico, and
              it's one of the safest, too. You'll quickly realize how much there
              is to discover - from authentic markets, some of the best street
              food, nearby ancient ruins, indigenous culture, sipping smokey
              mezcal at a distillery, or experiencing Day of the Dead
              festivities. Oaxaca feels like a magical place wtih an endless
              possibilites of things to do!
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Oaxaca has definitely grown in popularity within the last
              few years, it is by no means like Cancun or Cabo. Oaxaca is still
              a very authentic travel destination without the tourist traps and
              resorts. This is because the Oaxacan people embrace their roots,
              traditions, beliefs. For this reason, mostly only serious
              travelers who are interested in what Oaxaca does best - food,
              crafts, and culture - visit the beautiful city of Oaxaca.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Sandra and I have traveled all throughout the
              beautiful country of Mexico. My parents are both from Mexico and I
              wanted to connect with my cultural roots so I decided to go
              explore! I want to share with others that Mexico has more to offer
              than the toursit traps and resorts.
