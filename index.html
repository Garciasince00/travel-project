            <h2>Why Oaxaca?</h2>
            <h3>The culinary and culture capital of Mexico</h3>
            <p>
              Oaxaca's combo of authentic regional flavor and big city grit
              makes it one of the most intriguing destinations in Mexico, and
              it's one of the safest, too. You'll quickly realize how much there
              is to discover - from authentic markets, some of the best street
              food, nearby ancient ruins, indigenous culture, sipping smokey
              mezcal at a distillery, or experiencing Day of the Dead
              festivities. Oaxaca feels like a magical place wtih an endless
              possibilites of things to do!
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Oaxaca has definitely grown in popularity within the last
              few years, it is by no means like Cancun or Cabo. Oaxaca is still
              a very authentic travel destination without the tourist traps and
              resorts. This is because the Oaxacan people embrace their roots,
              traditions, beliefs. For this reason, mostly only serious
              travelers who are interested in what Oaxaca does best - food,
              crafts, and culture - visit the beautiful city of Oaxaca.

                <h4>Mezcal tour</h4>
                <p>
                  Mezcal is a distillate made from agave, an iconic plant of
                  Mexico. 70% of Mezcal is produced in Oaxaca and there are many
                  family-run distilleries you can visit where you can see how
                  the process of how mezcal is made. In town, there are several
                  bars and tasting rooms where you can take your time sampling a
                  few different kinds.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Mezcal plays an important role in the culture of Oaxaca, where
                  the great majority of mezcal comes from. It's not just a
                  drink, but forms a part of community identity. It's consumed
                  in celebrations, but also used in rituals and for healing
                  purposes. In this tour, you will not only taste Mezcal, but
                  you will learn how it's made, as well as it's history.

                <h4>Dia De Los Muertos</h4>
                <p>
                  Dia De Los Muertos is a national holiday celebrated in Mexico
                  from October 31 to November 2, that honors deceased loved ones
                  with altars, flowers, food, and drinks. During this time,
                  locals believe that the veil between the world of the spirits
                  and the living is lifted, so their deceased loved ones can
                  travel back for a visit. Oaxaca is considered the best place
                  to experience this festival because of its rich traditions and
                  rituals.
                </p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>
                  Everywhere! Main festivities and parades will be in the town
                  center.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  No where else in the world will you get to have this beautiful
                  experience other than Mexico, especially Oaxaca. I highly
                  recommend coming during this time. The festivities start early
                  and last for days, so be sure to book in advance!
